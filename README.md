    Q: How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Getting the correct ideas from a client is paramount, and making sure to get general 'core concepts' in an initial meeting and then breaking the core of what the client needs into smaller stories, they make it much easier for an over arching concept to be broken up into 5 peoples work; 'allow user to input a day and see what trips are available'  can be broken down into multiple smaller parts like 'dropdown box with relevant info, ' database for current avalailable trips', 'function to check input date with database information', this is basically how stories work and allow much harder projects to be broken down into smaller, more managable pieces.

    
    Q: How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My current approch, as a relative novice with programming is to first get an overview for what I need, and making points for what the major functionality/core logic will be, this is not unlike creating use stories for a vision board. Breaking things up works really well in my brain, as im the type to be overhwlemed with major requirememnts, but breaking things down helps make things ma lot less stressful. I hope to incorporate a better testing system with unit tests for myself, I find myswelf doing far less testing than I should, and Ive paid for it in the past with logic falling apart late into development, becuase I didnt properly test out specific cases on a function I wrote hours ago.


    
    Q: What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I think the core to being a good team member, and by extension a better part of communities in general, is be open to new ideas. LEt go of ego and focus on improving, even if that means being wrong. Collaboration is key to good software, and not thinking you know it all or have 'the best' implementation, but simply bring ideas to the table that the entire team can try out makes a team much more united and fosters a better sense of community within the team. Bring the skills you're confident in, suggest ideas for team members but dont push to hard, be open to new ideas and concepts, even if they sound wrong, sometimes the best solution isnt clearly defined, and thinking you have the best or only solutiojn helps no one when working together as a unit.
